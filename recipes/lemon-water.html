        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>2-4 Lemons</li>
            <li>4-8 Cubes of Ice</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps for making lemon water:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><h4>Make the ice:</h4><p>Grab out an ice tray and pour in some water that you have available at home. Put it in you freezer and wait 2.5-3 hours for the ice to fully freeze.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Cut your lemons:</h4><p>There are a few ways that you can choose to cut your lemons. The best way to cut them is right down the middle, inbetween the ends. Cutting them that way will make it easier for you to squeeze the juice if you're using a lemon juicer.</p>
            <p>For asthetic purposes, you could cut it down the middle and make another cut next to it so you have a slice of lemon to put on the edge of your glass.</p>
            <p>The last way to cut it is in wedges. Start by cutting it from end to end, then dp</p></li>
            <li><h4>Pour the water into the glass/pitcher:</h4><p>For this use a bottle of water, (if you don't have bottled water, you can use tap water depending on its drinkability.). Now pour the water into your container.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Squeeze the lemon juice into the water:</h4><p>This step is very self explanitory like the rest of the steps. Use a lemon squeezer or your bare hands to squeeze the juice into the glass/pitcher. Get the ice cubes that you put in the freezer a few hours ago, 
                and add them to your drink. Now you can relax with your refreshing glass of iced lemon water!</p></li>
        </ol>
