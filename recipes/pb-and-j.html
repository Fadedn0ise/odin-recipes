        The answer to that question is by not toasting it. If you want to step up your PB and J game, then you're in the right place.</p>
    <p>Follow this quick guide and you'll be chowing down in no time.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pieces of bread</li>
        <li>Jelly of your choice</li>
        <li>Peanut Butter of your choice</li>
        <li>(For stove toasting) Butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps for making a toasted peanut buttter and jelly sandwhich:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Choose how you want to toast your sandwhich:</h4><p>How you choose to toast you bread affects the order of how you'll make your sandwhich. You have two options; 
            toast your bread before you put the peanut butter and jelly on, or your second option to toast your sandwhich on a pan after you've put the peanut butter and jelly on, ( this is the better option, because it gets everything inside the sandwhich all warm.)</p></li>
        <li><h4>Spread the condiments on the bread:</h4>Once you've made that tough decision; start spreading the peanut butter and jelly on separate pieces of bread. If you chose to toast your bread before you put on the condiments then you should now have a delicious toasted pb and j in front of you. All that's left to do is enjoy!</li>
        <li><h4>Toast the sandwhich:</h4><p>If you chose to toast yours with the condiments on the inside then you're going to need a pan for this step. Put your pan on the stove and heat it at the medium heat setting on your stove. Next, drop some butter onto the pan and move it around to cover the whole pan.</p>
        <p>Once the butter has liquified in the pan; drop it in and use it let each side crips for about 1-1 1/2 minuets. When both sides are crips and golden you can take it out of the pan.</p>
        <p>Give it a minuet to cool down and enjoy your toasted peanut butter and jelly sandwhich!</p></li>
    </ol>
