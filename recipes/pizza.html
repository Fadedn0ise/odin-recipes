            <li>2 teaspoos khoser salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the pizza/toppings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>Cornmeal (to help slide the pizza onto the pizza stone)</li>
            <li>tomatoe sauce (smooth or pureed)</li>
            <li>Firm mozzarella cheese, separated into small clumps</li>
            <li>Fontina cheese, grated</li>
            <li>Parmesan cheese, grated</li>
            <li>Pepperoni, thinly sliced</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps for making the dough</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><h4>Proof the dough:</h4><p>Put the warm water into a stand mixer bowl.</p>
                <p>After waiting 5 minutes, stir if the yeast hasn't competely disolved</p>
                <p>(Be aware that if you choose to use "instant yeast" instead of "active yeast", you can skip the first step. Just make sure to add flour in the next step.)</p></li>
            <li><h4>Make and knead the pizza dough:</h4><p>Add in the flour, sugar, salt, and olive oil, and mix on low speed using the paddeling attachment for one minute.
                 After that, replace the mixing paddle with a dough hook attachment</p>
                <p>Let the hook knead the dough on a low to medium speed for about 6-9 minutes.</p>
                <p>For those how have been reading this that don't have a stand mixer, there is no need to worry. You can mix together the ingredients and knead the dough all by hand.</p>
                <p>At this point your dough should feel sticky. If it seems to be too wet, then you can just add more flour till the dough becomes sticky.</p>
            <li><h4>Let the dough rise:</h4><p>In a seprate large bowl, start spreading a thin layer of olive oil over the inside.
                 Now transfer the dough into the bowl and make sure that its turned so that it is fully coated in the olive oil.</p>
                <p>You can now decide how long the dough should ferment and rise.
                  If you're wanting to eat the pizza the same day you can go with a quick fermentation (1 1/2 hours stored warm). 
                  If you'd like to bring out more flavor from the dough then you should consider doing a slow fermentation (24 hours stored in the fridge).</p>
                <p>Once you've made a decision, cover the dough in plastic wrap.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Preping the pizzas</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><h4>Preheat the oven:</h4><p>Start preheating the oven at 475&deg;F for about 30 minutes.</p>
            <li><h4>Cut the dough in half:</h4></li><p>With the dough being fermented, we can start to do some work with it. Take the plastic cover off of the bowel containing your dough.
                     Before taking the dough out, coat your hands in flour to help cover the dough in flour. Push down the dough to help it deflate. With a kinfe you can now make a clean cut down the middle.</p>
                <p>Proced to roll the two pieces into round balls. Put each in seprate bowls, cover the top with plastic and let it rest of 30 minutes-2 hours</p>
                <li><h4>Prepare your toppings</h4></li><p>It may be tempting to pile on extra pepperoni and cheese, but its recommended not to so the crust can get a good crisp going.</p>
                <p>Going with a third cup of tomate sauce and cheese per pizza should be plenty.</p></li>
                <li><h4>Stretch and round the dough:</h4><p>Grab a ball of dough get to work on flattening it out on a surface that has light flour on it.</p>
                <p>Begin working at the center making the dough 1 1/2-in thick, then move out towards the end where your cust will end up. Flip the dough over and then work it till it can't stretch any more.
                     Then take a quick 5 minute break, then stretch it out to 10-12 inches.</p>
                <p>In the event that you do get a hole in it, <strong>DO NOT FREAK OUT!</strong> Simply push the dough back together and now the crisis is averted.</p>
                <p>On to the part of the pie that everyone saves for last, the <em>crust.</em> I like to have a nice thick crust to grip on when I grab a slice. Pinch out the size of the crust that you would like.
                     If you like a thicker crust like the one that I described, them make sure to give it a little extra dough.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Lather the dough in olive oil:</h4><p>Press the tips of your fingers all along the dough to avoid bubbling. Use a brush to coat the top of the dough with olive oil, and let it sit for 10 minutes.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Add sauce and toppings</h4><p>Grab your trusty ladle and gently add a light amount of sauce over the dough.
                 (If you like heavy sauce you can add more, but you need to make sure that you dough will be thick enough to support the sauce and topping.
                  If you add too much then you'll end up with a cool new pizza shirt when you take you first bite.) Pour the amount of sauce that you want to use for the whole pizza in the middle,
                  then use the ladle to spiral the sauce outward towards the crust.</p>
                <p>Sprinkle the cheeses on top of the sauce, (Tip: leve little areas where you can see the sauce, it will give a good ratio of cheese to sauce.). I'm a pepperoni lover myslef, so put as much to your hearts desire.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Put it in the oven and wait</h4><p>The oven is hot, and the pizza is waiting to get in there. It's time to pop your pizza in the oven and wait for your perfect pie to come out. 
                Leave it in there for 10-15 minutes and when you see that the crust is crisp and the cheese lookes golden its time to take it out and enjoy your hard work.</p></li>
